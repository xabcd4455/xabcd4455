# Perform following operation on given dataset.

# 1. Find Shape of Data

# 2. Find Missing Values

# 3. Find data type of each column

# 4. Finding out Zero's

# 5. Find Mean age of patients

# 6. Now extract only Age, Sex, ChestPain, RestBP, Chol. 

# Randomly divide dataset in training (75%) and testing (25%).

# Through the diagnosis test I predicted 100 report as COVID positive, but only 45 of those

# were actually positive. Total 50 people in my sample were actually COVID positive. I have

# total 500 samples. Create confusion matrix based on above data and find I. Accuracy II.

# Precision III. Recall IV. F-1 score
